nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

k = 2 → Meaning: We are allowed to flip at most 2 zeros to ones.

Goal:
Find the length of the longest contiguous subarray of 1s, where we can flip at most k zeros into ones.

Variables:
l = 0: Left pointer of the window
r = 0: Right pointer of the window
zeroCount = 0: Number of zeros in the current window
ans = 0: Max length of valid window seen so far

Understanding r - l + 1:
l: Left pointer of the window (starting index of current window).
r: Right pointer of the window (ending index of current window).
The length of the current window (i.e., the number of elements between l and r, inclusive) is:
Window Length=r−l+1
