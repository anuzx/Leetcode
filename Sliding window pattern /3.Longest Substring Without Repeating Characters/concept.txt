we will here use a dynamic sliding window to track unique characters 

expands if all characters are unique and shriks if dublicate char is found 

and hashset will be used to check dublicate characters 

how this works ?

initialise two pointers left and right to represent boundaries of current substring , both at idx 0 
use hashset to store the characters in the current window so that we can check for dublicates 

now if a char which is already present comes in the hashset shrink the window by moving the left pointer inside 
remove the characters from the hashset until dublicate is removed 

after each adjustment calc the length of substring and update it in max_length if required
