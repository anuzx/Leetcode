nums1 will have 0 0 0 in place on muns2 elements initially , so we will put larger element from either of two in the place of zeroes
and smaller elements in the starting

eg : Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

lets take a pointer i at last non zero element of nums1 and j at last non zero element of nums2 and a pointer K initially located at the last zero 

now if which so ever is greater we will put it at kth position
