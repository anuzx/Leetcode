basic approach will be to create an array with all element = 0 and then iterate through the original array and copy all non zero elements to
temp array and then copy the temp array to original array, but its space complexity will be O(n)

so we should only focus on shifting non zero elements to left 

now two pointers approach :

right pointer will scan the non zero ele in the array 
left pointer tracks where the non zero ele should be placed 

when the right pointer finds a non zero ele , we will swap it with the left pointer ele
