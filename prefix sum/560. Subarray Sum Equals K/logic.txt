if the difference between two prefix sums = k we have found a subarray that sums to k

if prefixSum[right] - prefixSum[left - 1] = k

the subarray b/w indices left and right will have sum of k

for each right idx there could be multiple left idx if the array contains -ve nums
therefore use :

prefixSum[right] - k = prefixSum[left - 1]

to store the frequency of each prefixsum we will use hash map
