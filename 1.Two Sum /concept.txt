we want to return idx and we have nums in the array so to link them we will use hashMap 

here key = array nums ( as they should be unique to get a unique solun)
and value will be the idx 

we will use one pointer and find the compliment of that num ( compli = target - nums[i])
and store that num in key and its idx in value if its compliment does not exist in the hashmap 

how to check ?

hm.conatainskey(compliment) 
if this returns true then :
hm.get(compliment) -> gives value of the given key -> return new int[]{ i , hm.get(compliment)}

else hm.put(nums[i] , i)

if all of this does not happen then this means we dont have an ans therefore return null ;
