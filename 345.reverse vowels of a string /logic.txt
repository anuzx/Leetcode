since we have to check char by char we will convert the string into array of char by using char [] word = s.toCharArray
so that now we can point to each char by their idx

word[start] means “the character at position start in the array.”
word[end] means “the character at position end in the array.”

now we will take two pointers at first and last idx 

String vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";

while (start < end && vowels.indexOf(word[start]) == -1) {
    start++;
}


this means we will keep moving the start pointer until it is less than end pointer value and also is not a vowel 

indexOf in Java is a method that searches a string for a character (or another string) and tells you the position (index) where it first appears. 
If the thing you’re searching for isn’t found, it returns -1.

and here we are not using <= as it will not give us the desired result because it will swap one more time
