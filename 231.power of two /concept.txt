A power of two has exactly one 1 bit in its binary form

1   -> 0001
2   -> 0010
4   -> 0100
8   -> 1000
16  -> 10000


What (n & (n - 1)) does
When you subtract 1 from a power of two, it turns off the only 1 bit and turns all bits after it to 1.

eg : n= 8  -> 1000
n - 1  = 7  -> 0111
n & (n - 1) = 1000 & 0111 = 0000

Why we also check n > 0
Because negative numbers or zero are not powers of two, but they can still pass the bitwise test if we donâ€™t check:
