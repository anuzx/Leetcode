in this we initalise 2 variables and move them across array and string according to ques 

pointer is a variable that represent a position within a data structure 
types :
1. converging pointers : pointers start at opp end and move inward towards each other 
2.parallel pointers : both pointers start at the same end (usually from start) and move in the same direction ,
right pointer is used to find new info and left pointer is used to track progress or maintain constrains (sliding window is a variation of this approach)
3.Trigger based pointers : we move one pointer independently untill it finds the element that meants a certain condition after that we start to move the 2nd pointer 
to find the additional info related to what the first pointer found (eg : to find Nth node of a linked list )

when to use ? 

on linear data struc like : array , string , linked list , pair of values or a result that can we generated by two values
